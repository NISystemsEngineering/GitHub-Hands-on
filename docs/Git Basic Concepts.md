# Git Basic Concepts
## Before You Begin
### Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com and create a new account. You should only use one account for all of your projects. GitHub has other mechanisms for separating personal projects from work projects.
### Download GitHub Desktop
Go to https://desktop.github.com/ and download the appropriate version for your OS.
## 1.1 Initialize a new Repository
To begin, we will create a new repository on our GitHub account.
1. From the splash screen or the **File** menu, select "Create new repository"

2. Fill out the fields for the new repository to be created.
	
	1. Give your new repository a name. Valid Git repository names don't have spaces, so if you attempt to give it a name with spaces it will change those spaces to dashes, e.g. "GitHub Tutorial" will be changed to "GitHub-Tutorial".
	
	2. Give your new repository a meaningful description.
	
	3. Choose a local directory for your new repository.
	
	4. Most software projects require documentation, and the easiest place to do that in GitHub is in the README.md file. If you want to create this file when you create repository, check the box.
	
	5. The Git ignore file tells a repository what files it should not track. For LabVIEW, we probably don't want to track imported libaries, shared objects, executables, or metadata. These files can be identified as files to ignore using their file extensions in the Git ignore file. We could manually create this file later, but GitHub provides a nice template for LabVIEW that already includes all of the relevant file types to exclude.
	
	6. **You MUST provide a license for your code.** If you intend to share this code, you should select MIT License or Apache License 2.0. If you don't select a license, then your code is considered unlicensed and get us in legal hot water. **ALWAYS PROVIDE A LICENSE**.
	
	7. Select "Create Repository".
	
	8. Navigate to the local folder on your computer and observe the files that were created.
	
	9. Go to your GitHub page online and observe the files that were created. A shortcut from Github Desktop to launch Github in a browser is **Repository >> View on Github (CTRL + SHIFT + G)**.
