# Git Basic Concepts
## Before You Begin
### Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com and create a new account. You should only use one account for all of your projects. GitHub has other mechanisms for separating personal projects from work projects.
### Download GitHub Desktop
Go to https://desktop.github.com/ and download the appropriate version for your OS.
## 1.1 Initialize a new Repository
To begin, we will create a new repository on our GitHub account.
